## Summary

Overfilling a Toyota U760 automatic transmission does **not** improve lubrication.
Instead, it causes **fluid aeration (foaming)**, **unstable hydraulic pressure**, and **transmission shudder**, especially during light acceleration.

The Toyota U760 is a **sealed transmission** with no dipstick and must be serviced using a **strict level-check procedure**.

---

## Understanding the Toyota U760 Transmission

The Toyota U760 is a 6-speed Aisin automatic transmission commonly found in:

- Toyota Camry  
- Toyota Corolla  
- Toyota RAV4  
- Toyota Highlander  

### Key design facts

- No dipstick  
- Fluid level is **not measured by volume**  
- Level is set by **fluid height at a specific temperature**  
- Uses an internal **overflow (check) tube**

Because of this design, **overfilling is just as harmful as underfilling**.

---

## Can Overfilling Cause Foaming and Oil Starvation?

**Yes.**

When ATF level exceeds specification:

- Rotating components whip the fluid  
- Air becomes trapped in the oil  
- ATF turns into foam  

Foamed ATF **cannot maintain stable hydraulic pressure**.

---

## What Happens When the U760 Is Overfilled

### 1. ATF Aeration (Foaming)

- Air bubbles compress  
- Oil does not  
- Hydraulic pressure becomes unstable  

### 2. Transmission Shudder

Most noticeable during:
- Light throttle acceleration  
- Torque converter lock-up  

### 3. Harsh or Erratic Shifting

- Delayed engagement  
- Inconsistent shift timing  

### 4. Possible Overheating

Aerated fluid cannot cool or lubricate properly, increasing thermal stress.

## Common Symptoms of an Overfilled U760 Transmission

- Shudder during acceleration  
- Harsh or erratic shifting  
- Delayed gear engagement  
- Possible overheating  
- Problem returns if fluid level is still incorrect  

---

## Correct Fix (Only Proper Method)

The only correct solution is to **set the fluid level properly**:

- Drain excess ATF  
- Engine must be running  
- Fluid temperature must be within Toyota specification  
- Fluid should **drip lightly** from the overflow tube  
- Reinstall check plug and road test  

⚠️ Guessing the fluid quantity or filling “until it feels right” will cause repeat problems.

---

## Key Takeaway

Overfilling a Toyota U760 transmission causes:

- Foaming  
- Oil starvation  
- Pressure instability  
- Shudder and poor shift quality  

This transmission must be serviced **by procedure, not assumption**.
